# LanguageExercises
So, here you can se some of my progress during my study time and i'll force to put everything i've done here, since the simplest exercise to the hardest.
Once it's a fixing exercise, it'll be here.
Projects and other things i'll put in other repositories.
Note: I'll always put a headline or a photo describing what was the problem solved and below the code.

Thanks for your visit !
Johm.
